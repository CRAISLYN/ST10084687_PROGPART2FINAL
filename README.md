•	About the program:
This is a student time management program that helps you plan your studying time. You enter your Course Name, Course Code, Credits, Class hours/ week, Weeks in semester, date of study, Course Name, Hours Studied, semester start date and then it’ll calculate your Self-Study Hours/Week and your Hours Remaining. The student time management program will make your life easier because you wont manually haver to record your information regarding your course and calculate the time you need and the time you spend on each course. You will also get a confirmation pop up message before you add you’re your information to make sure it is correct before you add it. You can even arrange your information in ascending order and there is a clear button feature where you can clear text instead of manually clearing each one. You can even swap between pages with the back and next button.
